# Machine-Learning-Model
I built this very basic machine learning model from scratch. First, I created training folder includes the photos of cat, dog, and rabbit downloaded from Google. Then, I trained the machine learning by showing the different photos of cat, bird, and rabbit I collected before. Finally, I created my machine learning model which recognizes the photos of cat, dog, and rabbit.
